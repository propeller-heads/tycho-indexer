//! # Deltas Client
//!
//! This module focuses on implementing the Real-Time Deltas client for the Tycho Indexer service.
//! Utilizing this client facilitates efficient, instant communication with the indexing service,
//! promoting seamless data synchronization.
//!
//! ## Websocket Implementation
//!
//! The present WebSocket implementation is cloneable, which enables it to be shared
//! across multiple asynchronous tasks without creating separate instances for each task. This
//! unique feature boosts efficiency as it:
//!
//! - **Reduces Server Load:** By maintaining a single universal client, the load on the server is
//!   significantly reduced. This is because fewer connections are made to the server, preventing it
//!   from getting overwhelmed by numerous simultaneous requests.
//! - **Conserves Resource Usage:** A single shared client requires fewer system resources than if
//!   multiple clients were instantiated and used separately as there is some overhead for websocket
//!   handshakes and message.
//!
//! Therefore, sharing one client among multiple tasks ensures optimal performance, reduces resource
//! consumption, and enhances overall software scalability.
