# Tessera V (Base) — Integration Research Handover (Phase 1)

> **Terminology (revised 2026-09-01)**: the protocol's own name for a market is a **pair**
> (`getTesseraPairs()`, and the engine's decompiled `registerPair`/`allPairs`/`pairKey`
> surface), and each pair is a **dedicated deployed contract**. Earlier revisions of this
> document called pairs "books" and their contracts "price stores" — both were borrowed from
> the BopAMM handover and are wrong for Tessera. Sections below may still carry the old words;
> where they do, read book = pair and price store = pair contract. §11 records the full
> revision.

Everything learned about Tessera's on-chain design on Base, verified against mainnet state via
archive `eth_call` / `eth_createAccessList` / storage probing (RPC: `base.gateway.tenderly.co`),
2026-08-28. Extends the phase-0 assessment (`docs/research/tessera-base-assessment.md`) and the plan
(`.claude/plans/tessera-base-integration.md`, Confluence page 3930849284). **Three plan assumptions
are revised by this document — see §9.**

> Tessera V is Wintermute's propAMM: no pools, no curves. A per-book **price store** receives an
> operator price post **every block**; a single **treasury** holds all inventory; the verified
> `TesseraSwap` entrypoint settles against it by allowance. Integration type: VM (`vm:tessera`).

## 1. Contract topology (revised — per-book stores)

The assessment's "fixed 6-contract set" was wrong: it access-listed only the WETH book. Each book
has its **own store contract** (an EIP-1967 proxy), all pointing at one shared implementation.

### Per-book stores (live books, 2026-08-28)

All are 1,971-byte EIP-1967 proxies → impl `0x6d9d…41cb`. Proxy bytecode is **not** byte-identical
across books (embedded immutables) — do not fingerprint by code hash; fingerprint by the init-time
EIP-1967 implementation-slot write (§5).

| Book | Store | slot 50 (price signer EOA) |
|---|---|---|
| WETH/USDC | `0xf524c1bc1c64a2c99bc7eccf19ede9a1d89d5a7c` | `0x9dd48a40bb70b21aa94428a712e4ad65bff26bfb` |
| cbBTC/USDC | `0xed57bacdc2a990b631f8817853935791c122c356` | `0x3ebe6b6dfaeaa2b205e79e749390b2e9ea76c978` |
| EURC/USDC | `0x4b963fb4a26f082d94f964fa3c2764821cc06bd4` | `0x5aa7c10470ed455132c0e93e67e712b05bcd3a21` |
| VIRTUAL/USDC | `0xe1191102bdcea1928a93b4d6ea7bf5c4e9207210` | `0x56112ecc5c3a3ad26df2c1e5fc995e2e47aa7b20` |
| AERO/USDC | `0x3b84be4d48888a6bc385eea93e522246b214069e` | `0xf75c8d7864d4d9c039de17cbb74c810094c79e56` |
| VVV/USDC | `0x402e0d314fd6f55348df7cc478bab811826e3e91` | `0xd52f194ff7b52aae71b1485228a50460da1eaefc` |
| deSPXA/USDC | `0x4955d3c5c755f654cd27ada9f085ded00469fbc8` | `0xaa2f721ee57f5f5bafbad95c484b4b131c52cc1f` |
| NVDAc/USDC | `0xede940cdf2a9c5620cbf97e45947594723e29c14` | `0xee6cb1eeb0a141a54b5c5faa94a50859c288e120` |
| USDT/USDC (disabled) | `0x532c782afd8f6a1deed25d274235674a624a002f` | — |

Each book has its **own price-post signer EOA** (store slot 50) — liveness monitoring must be
per book, not per venue.

### Swap access set (what a quote/swap actually touches)

`eth_createAccessList` on `tesseraSwapViewAmounts` / `swapAmount`:
`TesseraSwap (slots 0–2)` + `engine (slots 0, 5, 10, + one keccak slot per book)` + `the book's
store (slots 0–27, 48–51, EIP-1967 impl slot)` + code-only: impl + the book's pricing lib.
No token contracts, no external oracles, no other books' stores. **No DCI needed** — but the
tracked-contract set is *dynamic* (per-book stores + impl generations), see §5/§9.

## 2. Interfaces

### TesseraSwap (verified — see Basescan)

| Selector | Signature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `0x77f65f98` | `tesseraSwapViewAmounts(address,address,int256) → (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut)` | `amountSpecified > 0` exact-in, `< 0` exact-out. Sender-independent. Byte-identical to the executable path at a pinned block. |
| — | `tesseraSwapWithAllowances(address,address,int256,uint256 amountCheck,address recipient,bytes swapData)` | The aggregator path. `swapData` may be empty. Exact-in: requires `amountOut >= amountCheck`. |
| — | `tesseraSwapWithCallback(...,bytes callbackData,bytes swapData)` | Flash-style; not needed for Tycho. |
| — | `changeTesseraEngine(address)` / `changeTesseraTreasury(address)` | owner-only, **no event, no timelock**. |
| event | `TesseraTrade(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut, address recipient)` | topic0 `0x97ba0cd8…ad6a`, all fields unindexed. |

### Engine (unverified)

| Selector | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `swapAmount(address,address,int256,address,bytes)` | pricing + settlement inner call; reverts `T37` unless caller is TesseraSwap | verified source of TesseraSwap |
| `swapAmountView(address,address,int256,address)` | open view | quotes served |
| `0xb8744eb4` | **create/configure book** (admin) — first arg is the base token | inner calldata of the deSPXA creation Safe tx `0x1938ddaf…9958` @ 44,091,817 |
| revert `T33` | unknown/unsupported token pair | BSC probe |

Engine storage: `slot0` = `0x…01 ‖ TesseraSwap` (packed flag+address); `slot5` = `0x77359400`
(2e9 — role unknown, open); `slot10` = recent block number (updated with posts; **not** a gate —
overriding it does not change quotes); one keccak-derived slot per book = token → store mapping
(hash preimage not recovered — Solidity/Vyper standard layouts ruled out for bases 0–127; **not
needed**, discovery keys off store creation, §5).

### Store (per book; storage layout of gen-3 impl `0x6d9d…`)

| Slot | Content | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | packed price post: byte0 = counter, bytes1–5 = **post block number**, then price mantissa + counters. **Changes every block.** | diffed across consecutive blocks; drives the freshness gate (§4) |
| 1 | owner ‖ flag bytes (`…dbd31ea…0101`) | read |
| 2 | engine address | read |
| 3, 4 | cumulative quote-side / base-side volume counters (slot 3 reappears in the trade event's last data word) | correlated |
| 5–7 | packed config (bps-scale constants: 10000, 1000, 500, 102400, …) — spread/fee params, exact semantics open (VM makes them moot) | read |
| 8–16 | quote ladder: (level, size) pairs; ladder sum ≈ max quotable clip | bisected max ≈ ladder sum |
| 48 | **base token address** | matches all 8 stores incl. disabled USDT |
| 49 | `0x00 06 <base_decimals> ‖ quote token (USDC)` — e.g. `0x000612…` for 18-dp bases | matches all stores |
| 50 | per-book **price signer EOA** | all 7 differ, 0 code |
| 51 | per-book pricing lib address (code-only contract) | matches access lists; **written after creation**, zero at init |
| EIP-1967 impl slot | store implementation | init-written in the creation tx |

Store events: `0x56441808e0dc…326e` = per-fill event — topic1 taker, topic2/3 signed base/quote
deltas, data = [token0, token1, fill counter, cumulative, price ×1e6]. `0x61e15d1624…f23b` = rare
counter event (topic1 = small int, no data) — heartbeat/epoch, not needed. **Price posts emit no
event** — indexing must be storage-driven (as planned).

## 3. Pricing determinism

Pure function of: engine storage + the book store's storage + `block.number` (freshness, §4).
No signature checks, no ecrecover/EIP-1271 on the pricing path, no token reads, no external oracle,
no `block.timestamp`. Cross pairs (e.g. WETH→cbBTC) quote and settle **directly**, bridged through
USDC internally — the hub-and-spoke BopAMM pattern; component model stays one book per base/USDC.

## 4. Freshness gate (measured — revises the assessment)

The quote **decays with the age of the last price post** (store slot0 bytes1–5 vs `block.number`),
then dies:

| post age (blocks) | quote |
|---|---|
| 0–4 | full price |
| 5–7 | ramping down (≈ −10 to −40 bps) |
| 8–19 | ≈ **−100 bps** plateau |
| ≥ ~20 | **0** (dead) |

Measured by state-overriding the embedded post block at a pinned head (two runs, consistent).
The assessment's "no staleness gate" was an artifact of historical probing: state and block env move
together, so a *relative* gate is invisible. Consequences:

- Simulation from indexed state at block N with env N is always fresh (posts land every block) — exact.
- The simulation env's block number **must** equal the indexed block (default `EVMPoolState`
  behavior) — simulating old state under a newer block env understates or zeroes quotes.
- Operator halt ⇒ books quote 0 within ~40 s. Self-limiting; alert if any store's slot0 stops
  changing for N blocks (per book, via its signer EOA).

## 5. Discovery, lifecycle, mutations

**Book creation** (evidence: deSPXA @ 44,091,817, tx `0x1938ddaf…9958`): the owner Safe
`execTransaction` → engine `0xb8744eb4(baseToken, …)`; the engine **internally CREATEs** the store
proxy (no top-level `contractAddress`), and in the same tx: store init writes slots **48**
(base token), **49** (decimals ‖ USDC), **50** (signer), and the **EIP-1967 impl slot**; the engine
writes its token→store mapping slot (value = store address). Slot 51 (pricing lib) is written later.

**Substreams discovery predicate** (layout-independent): a contract created in-block whose init
writes include the EIP-1967 implementation slot **and** slots 48/49 (two addresses, second = USDC)
⇒ new book. Cross-check the engine also wrote a slot whose value = that address in the same tx.
Component id proposal: `0x` + `TesseraSwap (20B) ‖ base token last 12B` — unique per book, stable
across store re-deploys; `contracts = [TesseraSwap, engine, store_i, impl_gen, lib_i, 0x7034…]`.

**Book removal** = disable: quote returns `(amountIn, 0)`; the store keeps its code, slots 48/49,
and even gets impl upgrades. Delisted books self-disable in `getLimits` (0). No component-removal
handling needed.

**Impl upgrades are routine.** Three generations observed: `0xf3be571a…` (at first store creation
37,518,780) → `0x10182fda…` (deployed 43,832,837) → `0x6d9d…41cb` (deployed 49,879,701 by EOA
`0x3b9e5466…`, top-level; fleet-wide upgrade including disabled stores). USDT + ZORA were
**upgrade-test books**: created in the gen-3 deploy window, 9 trades each over ~87 min
(49,881,382–49,883,986), then disabled. Substreams must track EIP-1967 impl-slot writes on every
store; a new impl address is a new tracked contract whose deployment must be witnessed (see §9 risk).

**Treasury rotated once**: `0xc2ca2485618af14135e79487492c3a4f2a062ed5` → `0x3dbe077e…` at block
**37,737,344** (~2.5 days post-launch). `balance_owner` must be a dynamic attribute keyed off
TesseraSwap `slot1` writes. Engine (slot0) and owner (slot2) unchanged since deploy.

## 6. Balance / inventory model

Single treasury backs all books (≈ $1.27M across 8 tokens); unlimited allowance to TesseraSwap.
No per-book reserves. BopAMM model applies unchanged: `balanceOf` snapshot seeding on discovery and
treasury rotation, ERC20 `Transfer` + WETH `Deposit`/`Withdrawal` deltas, USDC duplicated under
every book, `self_contained_tokens` static attribute.

## 7. Sides, limits, connectivity

- Exact-in (`amountSpecified > 0`) and exact-out (`< 0`) both work and round-trip exactly.
- Oversize / disabled book → `(amountIn, 0)`, never reverts. Unknown token → revert `T33`.
- Max clip ≈ quote-ladder sum (store slots 8–16); WETH ≈ 139 WETH (~$348k) at probe time.
  Configured in storage, not read from balances — `getLimits` bisection is correct.
- All books quote vs USDC; cross pairs bridge internally. Component per book vs USDC.

## 8. Lifecycle reference

| Block | Event |
|---|---|
| 37,518,648 | TesseraSwap + engine deployed (= earliest family deploy, package `initialBlock`) |
| 37,518,780 | WETH store created (impl gen-1 `0xf3be571a…`) |
| 37,737,344 | treasury rotation `0xc2ca2485…` → `0x3dbe077e…` |
| 43,832,837 | impl gen-2 `0x10182fda…` deployed |
| 44,091,817 | deSPXA book created (Safe tx `0x1938ddaf…9958`) |
| 49,879,701 | impl gen-3 `0x6d9d…41cb` deployed (EOA `0x3b9e5466…`) |
| 49,881,382–49,883,986 | USDT + ZORA test books live (9 trades each), then disabled |
| 50,526,653 | NVDAc/USDC book created (tokenized NVIDIA, 8 dp; Safe tx `0x3447f2ec…a5cb` proposed by `0x3b9e5466…` — the same EOA that deployed the gen-3 impl) — the token set is actively growing |

BSC: same TesseraSwap/engine/treasury addresses, different owner (`0xae3c0084…`); WBNB/USDT quotes
revert `T33` — **venue not configured/live on BSC** (2026-08-28). Re-check before planning BSC.

## 9. Plan revisions (vs `.claude/plans/tessera-base-integration.md`)

1. **D2/D3 revised — the tracked-contract set is dynamic, not a fixed 6-address params list.**
   Per-book stores are created by the engine at book creation; impls rotate (3 generations in 10
   months). Still **no DCI**: every creation is witnessable in-block. The substreams needs a
   Curve-style dynamic predicate (store module accumulating tracked addresses) instead of a fixed
   predicate. Params carry the *stable* addresses (TesseraSwap, engine, USDC, deployer EOA) + the
   discovery slot constants (48/49/50/51 + EIP-1967 slot).
2. **Freshness gate exists** (relative, §4). No `override_block_timestamp` machinery needed, but
   the adapter/harness must simulate with block env = indexed block (default behavior — assert it
   in tests). Add per-book post-liveness monitoring (store slot0 vs head).
3. ~~**Impl-generation bootstrap risk**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-09-09, §12)**: the implementation,
   pricing lib and write-path contract are no longer indexed at all. Their addresses are read from
   the pair's own storage slots and published as `stateless_contract_addr_{0,1,2}` attributes;
   the consumer fetches their code over RPC. Neither the deployer-EOA idea (there are ≥5 rotating
   deployer keys) nor the params runbook is needed.

## 9.5 Adversarial-review findings (2026-08-28, addressed in-package)

An independent review of the Phase 2–4 diff found and the package now fixes:

1. **Components must not reference not-yet-deployed contracts** (sync-breaking): the storage
   layer resolves every `contracts` entry against known accounts and fails the flush on a miss.
   Components carry only `[TesseraSwap, engine, own pair]`. (The follow-up in this item —
   delivering the code-only contracts as plain account changes via a `tracked` params list —
   turned out never to reach consumers at all; superseded by §12.)
2. **Seed-skip granularity** (balance drift): snapshot suppression of event deltas is per
   `(token, component)` — a new book's USDC seed no longer swallows same-block USDC deltas on
   the other books.
3. **Rotation-block accounting**: event deltas in a rotation block are matched against the
   *old* custodian and the re-seed is `balanceOf(new) − balanceOf(old)` at end-of-block —
   exact even when inventory migrates within the rotation block. (Verified live: the 37,737,344
   rotation had zero in-block flows — the old treasury was drained in earlier blocks.)
4. **Store re-deploy resilience**: `all_books` dedupes by component id so a store re-deploy for
   an existing base token cannot double the USDC fan-out (which would panic the balance store on
   duplicate ordinals).
5. **Pricing-lib visibility**: writes to the pair's lib slot (51) are surfaced as an attribute
   (originally `book_lib`, a monitoring alert; since §12 it is `stateless_contract_addr_1`, which
   the consumer acts on directly).
6. Balance deltas sort by `(tx index, ordinal)` so one transaction's deltas stay contiguous for
   the downstream aggregation; `store_treasury` uses the padded word decoder.

## 9.6 Upgrade cadence — CORRECTED 2026-09-01 (was materially wrong)

Earlier revisions of this document said "3 implementation generations in 10 months, ~every 4-5
months". That came from a sampling error: a binary search for the *first* change plus deploy-block
lookups for three addresses already known from recent access lists, treated as the full set.

A complete enumeration (coarse sampling + per-segment bisection of the EIP-1967 slot on the WETH
and cbBTC pairs, whose transition blocks match exactly ⇒ fleet-wide `upgradeAllTo`) gives:

**12 implementation generations, 11 upgrades in 286 days — a mean interval of 26 days**, shortest
2 days:

| block | date | implementation |
|---|---|---|
| 37,518,780 | 2025-10-30 | `0xf3be571a…` (creation) |
| 38,955,210 | 2025-12-02 | `0x0bd16207…` |
| 39,081,165 | 2025-12-05 | `0x3c3b4275…` |
| 40,761,403 | 2026-01-13 | `0x5bb9486e…` |
| 42,118,215 | 2026-02-13 | `0x69c980d4…` |
| 42,930,200 | 2026-03-04 | `0x42d0e058…` |
| 43,278,147 | 2026-03-12 | `0xa01f5e35…` |
| 43,528,991 | 2026-03-18 | `0x32a0bcc0…` |
| 43,833,660 | 2026-03-25 | `0x10182fda…` |
| 48,155,369 | 2026-07-03 | `0xffeeb848…` |
| 49,533,036 | 2026-08-04 | `0x995d3dfb…` |
| 49,880,623 | 2026-08-12 | `0x6d9dd143…` (current) |

**The pricing lib is mutable too** — slot 51 starts at zero and has taken four non-zero values,
including non-zero→non-zero transitions, and the per-pair grouping itself changes:
`0xbb3f6e64…` (2026-03-18) → `0xd4e32939…` (2026-03-25) → `0x9f924c07…` (2026-04-12) →
`0xfdb7fa3f…` (2026-04-28, WETH/cbBTC only; the other pairs stay on `0x9f924c07…`).

**Consequences (as assessed 2026-09-01).**

1. The then-current `tracked` params were missing **9 implementation generations and 2 lib
   generations**, and the manual "append to params, re-release the spkg, re-sync" runbook, sized
   against a 4-5 month cadence, is not viable at 26 days.
2. The failure mode is safe: a missing implementation means no code at the delegate target, the
   simulation errors on the missing account, and the pair drops out of routing. Down, not
   mispriced.

**Resolution (2026-09-09): §12.** The `tracked` params are gone; upgrades are followed through
`stateless_contract_addr_{i}` attributes with no operator action.

## 10. Open questions (not blocking Phase 2)

- ~~Pre-rotation balance drift~~ **RESOLVED (2026-08-28)**: the drift was a **self-transfer
  double-count** — the venue's first test swap (block 37,519,381, tx `0x79faebf9…3d41`) contains
  `Transfer(from=treasury, to=treasury, 3444538)` and the delta matcher's inflow branch credited
  it (+$3.44 exactly; the WETH drift came from WETH self-transfers the same way). Fixed:
  `from == to` transfers now net zero. Independent per-block eth_getLogs reconciliation of the
  whole pre-rotation epoch matches the true balances to the wei with this one correction. Two
  side-findings: substreams store-prep eth_calls execute at **end-of-block** state (the seed
  values that persist are correct; a re-streamed map's printed eth_call results can differ — an
  RPC-cache artifact, not an accounting input), and **the same self-transfer bug exists upstream
  in `ethereum-bopamm`'s maker delta matcher** (flagged for a separate fix).

- Identity of `0x7034c5c7…` (one slot written per swap — nonce/accounting?). Tracked regardless.
- Engine slot5 (`2e9`) and store slots 5–7 config semantics (VM executes them; labels only).
- Engine token→store mapping hash preimage (nice for cross-checks; discovery does not need it).
- Exact decay-curve shape between blocks 5–8 and the precise dead cutoff (19 vs 20).
- A store re-deploy for an existing base token would re-emit the component creation (same id,
  new `price_store` attribute) — behavior of the extractor on a duplicate creation is untested;
  the balance path is now safe (dedupe), monitoring would see the `store_impl`/`book_lib`
  attributes move.
- Whether the two per-book pricing libs (`0xfdb7…`, `0x9f924c…`) are generations or book-class
  variants (majors vs tail) — watch which lib new books get.

## 11. Revision 2026-09-01 — engine decompilation, pair-address ids, quote-token constraint removed

A community decompilation of the engine (dedaub AI reconstruction, cross-checked on-chain) plus a
full enumeration of the engine's pair registry revised the package:

### Engine layout (verified against live storage)

| Slot | Content | Verified value |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | packed `flag ‖ owner` — owner is TesseraSwap (explains the `T37` caller gate) | `0x…01 ‖ 0x5555…9e3e` |
| 1 | **bridge token** — the 2-hop routing intermediate; the decompiled `_route` falls back to `(in, bridge)+(bridge, out)` only when no direct pair exists (verified: WETH→cbBTC quotes through it with no direct pair registered) | USDC |
| 2 | pair implementation used for upgrades (`upgradeAllTo`) | `0x6d9d…41cb` (gen 3) |
| 3 | operator (writes slot 10 block-number heartbeat) | `0x2435…5bb6` |
| 4 | killSwitch — can `disableTrading`/`enableTrading` on every pair | `0xae09…f66e` |
| 5 | scalar `0x77359400` (2e9) — role open | |
| 6 | **pair array length** (registration order; keys at `keccak(6) + i`) | 15 |
| 8 | base slot of `pairKey => pair contract` mapping | |

**The pair-mapping slot formula** (verified 15/15, including the disabled USDT pair):
`slot = keccak256(abi.encode(pairKey, 8))` with
`pairKey = keccak256(abi.encode(tokenLo, tokenHi))`, tokens sorted ascending. Implemented as
`common::engine_pair_slot` and unit-tested; `cast` recipe:
`cast index bytes32 $(cast keccak $(cast abi-encode "f(address,address)" $LO $HI)) 8`.

The admin selector `0xb8744eb4` (owner Safe → engine) is the **pair creation** call: args are
`(baseToken, quoteToken, baseDecimals, quoteDecimals, 1e6, …ladder config…)`; the engine CREATEs
the pair contract internally. The decompiled `registerPair(address,address,address)` (register an
externally created pair) exists but has never been used.

### The registry holds 15 pairs — two are not USDC-quoted

Full enumeration via slot 6 + the mapping formula: WETH, cbBTC, VIRTUAL, AERO, THQ, VVV, EURC,
USDT, deSPXA, NVDAc, AAPLc, GOOGLc, METAc — all vs USDC — **plus WETH/USDbC
(`0xfcb771ff…`) and ZORA/USDT (`0xe77ed480…`)**. Both non-USDC pairs quote zero today, but they
prove the venue is not single-quote by construction; only ~half the registry is enumerated by
`getTesseraPairs()` (live pairs only).

### Package changes

1. **Component id = the pair's contract address** (was `TesseraSwap ‖ base-token low 12B`, which
   collides for WETH/USDC vs WETH/USDbC). A re-deployed pair is a new component.
2. **Quote-token constraint removed**: discovery accepts any quote token; the engine registry
   write is now matched at the **exact** derived mapping slot (was: any engine write carrying the
   pair address). `quote_token` joins `base_token` as a static attribute.
3. **Token index is append-valued** (`store_pairs`): one token can back several pairs. Balance
   fan-out is now uniform — a token's treasury balance is duplicated under every pair containing
   it; the USDC special case is gone.
4. **Adapter**: pool id is the pair address; tokens come from the pair's own
   `baseToken()`/`quoteToken()` getters (verified selectors `0xc55dae63`/`0x217a4b70`); the
   pair-list helper and the USDC constructor argument are dropped; `getPoolIds` reverts
   `NotImplemented` (no on-chain token→pair enumeration exists).
5. Attributes renamed: `store_impl` → `pair_impl`; `price_store` dropped (redundant with the id);
   `book_lib` → `pair_lib`; protocol type `tessera_book` → `tessera_pair`.

## 12. Delegate targets as `stateless_contract_addr_{i}` (2026-09-09)

### What changed

The pair implementation (EIP-1967 slot), pricing lib (pair slot 51) and write-path contract (pair
slot 52) are no longer indexed. Every write to one of those slots on a known pair is published as
an attribute on that pair's component — `stateless_contract_addr_0` / `_1` / `_2`, value = the
address as a UTF-8 `0x…` string — and `tycho-simulation` fetches the code over `RPC_URL`
(`vm/decoder.rs` → `state_builder.rs` on snapshot; `state.rs::delta_transition` on update). The
`tracked` params list, its runbook, and the satellite entries in `initialized_accounts` are gone.
Package version 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 (attribute names changed: `pair_impl` → `_0`, `pair_lib` → `_1`).

### Why the previous design could not have worked

The `tracked` list did put the implementation's code into the **indexer** DB, but nothing ever
carried it to a **consumer**. `tycho-client` fetches exactly the accounts in the components'
`contract_addresses` (`feed/synchronizer.rs`, `fetch_snapshot` and the live path) and drops
account deltas outside that set; a component's contract list is written once at creation
(`postgres/protocol.rs::add_protocol_components`) and only DCI can extend it. Our components list
`[TesseraSwap, engine, pair]`, so the implementation was never delivered, and `PreCachedDB` has no
RPC fallback (`tycho_db.rs::basic_ref` → `MissingAccount`). This was not caught because the
protocol-testing harness resolves accounts the same way and its end-to-end run had not been done;
the adapter fork tests run directly against a fork and never touch the Tycho delivery path.

### Alternatives measured and rejected

- **Witness the deploy via a deployer-EOA predicate**: the six resolvable satellites were deployed
  by four distinct EOAs (`0x61e9…`, `0x5745…`, `0xbf2c…`, `0x60a8…`), plus `0x3b9e…` for gen-12 —
  rotating keys, nothing to key on.
- **Witness the deploy via a bytecode fingerprint**: the four engine→pair selectors (`4c7c47b7`,
  `4a036fcb`, `c55dae63`, `217a4b70`) are present in 12/12 implementation generations, so this
  *would* identify a new implementation at its deployment block. It only fixes the indexer side,
  which — per the previous section — is not the side that was broken. Kept on record in case DCI
  or an indexer-side delivery mechanism ever makes indexer-held code reachable.
- **DCI**: would follow upgrades automatically (re-trace on slot change) but needs
  `debug_traceCall`, which our Base RPC does not offer.

### Behaviour on an upgrade

1. Owner Safe → engine `upgradeAllTo(newImpl)`; each pair's EIP-1967 slot flips.
2. Substreams: the slot write is a storage change on an indexed pair → `stateless_contract_addr_0`
   update on every pair in that block, plus `update_marker`.
3. Consumer already running: `delta_transition` sees the attribute, `eth_getCode(newImpl)`, loads
   the account, re-simulates. Consumer starting later: the snapshot carries the new attribute and
   the decoder loads it. No restart, no params change, no spkg release.
4. Failure modes stay fail-safe: RPC unreachable → `RecoverableError`, pool errors until the next
   attribute or restart; never a stale price.

Attribute indices are read contiguously by the consumer, so `_2` is invisible until `_1` exists.
On Base the lib is always assigned before the write-path contract (NVDAc: 50,527,583 vs
50,527,613) and a pair without a lib cannot quote, so this ordering costs nothing.

### What still cannot be followed dynamically

Only the engine (`changeTesseraEngine`). It is stateful and sits in every component's contract
list, so a replacement is a re-index. It has never been called on Base; the `engine` attribute
remains as the alert.

### Verification (2026-09-09)

- Substreams: 24 unit tests, clippy clean, wasm built. tycho-simulation: `delta_transition`
  reload covered by two tests (inline code loaded; non-UTF-8 address rejected).
- The `protocols/testing` harness had **never run** for this package: the substreams-integration
  workflow's change detection produced an empty package list on every run of this branch, and a
  manual `workflow_dispatch` then passed vacuously because the composite action exported
  `PROTOCOL` while `docker-compose.yaml` reads `${PROTOCOLS}` (container ran with an empty
  package name, "Config file not found", exit 0). Both are fixed/flagged: the env name on this
  branch (`ci: pass PROTOCOLS …`), the detection and the exit-0 behaviour as follow-up tasks.
- With the harness actually running, the NVDAc-range test could not bootstrap TesseraSwap and the
  engine: every Base archive node reachable (Tenderly gateway, public endpoints, Chainstack, and
  CI's `BASE_RPC_URL_ARCHIVE`) answers `null` or "method not found" to `debug_storageRangeAt`, the
  only method the indexer uses for `initialized_accounts`. `base-aerodrome-v1` and
  `base-aerodrome-slipstreams` use `initialized_accounts` too and will hit the same wall once CI
  stops passing vacuously.
- The integration test therefore moved to the venue's genesis range **37,518,600 → 37,519,400**
  (deployment of TesseraSwap/engine at 37,518,648, first pairs at 37,518,780, first posts from
  37,519,101, first swap at 37,519,381; WETH/USDC post age 2 at the stop block, quoting
  ~97 USDC/WETH — the venue's test-phase price). No `initialized_accounts` — the production
  path. Run it in CI with
  `gh workflow run ci-substreams-integration.yaml --ref <branch> -f protocols=base-tessera`.
- **Genesis-range result (local, Tenderly gateway; CI run pending at time of writing)**: indexing
  → component discovery (`0xf524…` matches id, tokens, static attributes, creation tx) → snapshot
  → consumer loads `stateless_contract_addr_0` (`0xf3be571a…`) over RPC all pass; indexed WETH and
  USDC balances equal the genesis treasury's (`0xc2ca2485…`) on-chain `balanceOf` to the wei. The
  harness's own balance check compares against `balanceOf(<component id>)` — the pair, which holds
  nothing — so it is skipped with that justification. **Quoting on the gen-1 implementation does
  not work in a VM**: `getLimits` → `tesseraSwapViewAmounts` → engine → pair → gen-1 impl reverts
  (arithmetic panic 0x11 after reading the fee threshold and the caller whitelist flag, both zero,
  under gas price 0; reproduced by etching the harness's exact adapter runtime into a forge fork
  at 37,519,400, and the VM run fails in the same `getLimits` call with an empty revert). On-chain
  `eth_call` at the same block succeeds only because nodes zero the base fee when no gas price is
  given. gen-12 has no such branch (the adapter's 12 fork tests at 50,548,423 pass). The test
  declares `skip_simulation: true` for this reason. Note the harness tolerates decode failures
  (`skip_state_decode_failures(true)`) and reported "passed" with 0 decoded pools before the flag
  was set — a green run with no simulation is possible and should be read with `Decoded N
  snapshots` in mind.
- What remains unverified end-to-end: a gen-12-era tycho-simulation quote through the Tycho
  delivery path. It needs either a Base node with `debug_storageRangeAt` (none available, see
  above) or slot-list support for `initialized_accounts`; the rollout phase's live sync + markout
  run covers it.
