# Changelog

## v0.2.3

- Track Ve33 pool swap-fee changes for accurate off-chain quotes. The Ve33
  extension address is chain-specific and passed via the module params
  query string (`ve33_address=0x...`, serde_qs like the other packages);
  omitting it (e.g. on Ethereum) disables Ve33 handling.
- Add a `robinhood-ekubo-v3.yaml` manifest with the Robinhood Ve33 extension
  address baked into the module params, plus a Robinhood integration test
  config covering the first Ve33 pool.

## v0.2.2

- Track the second TWAMM extension deployment
  (`0xd47f1b1edcfeabb08f6ebd8fc337c27e636c75ba`), first used in block 24995117.
  Both deployments are now recognized as TWAMM emitters and as extensions
  carrying time-rate deltas.

## v0.2.1

- Align the `Cargo.toml` package version with the `substreams.yaml` manifest
  version, which has been `v0.2.1` since the CI fix. No behavior change.

## v0.1.3

- Replace the `SIGNED_EXCLUSIVE_SWAP_ADDRESS` placeholder with the deployed
  SignedExclusiveSwap extension address, so `is_exclusive` tagging matches
  real signed pools on-chain.

## v0.1.2

- Tag SignedExclusiveSwap pools with the reserved `is_exclusive` static attribute
  (value `[1u8]`) at component creation, so consumers can keep pools requiring
  off-chain swap authorization out of public routing.

## v0.1.1

- Pin the Rust toolchain to 1.96.0 for reproducible wasm builds. The package
  previously had no toolchain pin and built with whatever stable was current.
