/// `PrioUpdateRegistry`. The router only reads a lane whose committed
/// `updateTimestamp` sits inside `laneWindow` of `block.timestamp`, and reverts
/// `StaleUpdate` otherwise; simulation pins the timestamp through the
/// `override_block_timestamp` attribute the substreams package emits.
///
/// The adapter is quote-only: it never calls a settlement entrypoint. Every
/// `swap*` function on the router is gated on `allowedTaker[msg.sender]`, and
/// the adapter runs at a synthetic address that is not on that allowlist, so
/// executing settlement here would revert `TakerNotAllowed` regardless of the
/// pool's real state. Nothing is lost by quoting instead: `quote` and
/// `quoteExactOut` are `view`, ungated, and already enforce every condition
/// settlement would — pause state, pair registration, lane freshness, ladder
/// size, and (via `_checkVaultCover`) that the vault holds `amountOut` AND has
/// granted the router a standing allowance for it. A quote that succeeds is a
/// swap that would settle.
