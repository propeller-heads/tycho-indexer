# tycho-indexer

Main indexing engine: connects to Substreams, processes block data, persists finalized state, and

## ProtocolExtractor

`ProtocolExtractor<G, T, E>` is generic over gateway `G`, token pre-processor `T`, and optional
extension `E`. It is the single point that turns raw Substreams messages into typed block data.

### Normal (full-block) path

1. Deserialize `BlockScopedData` → `BlockChanges` (tx-level state/balance deltas) via
   `tycho-protobuf`'s `TryFromMessage` conversions; its `DecodeError` converts into
   `ExtractionError`.
2. Run post-processor if configured.
3. Call `E::process_block_update()` (DCI — see below).
4. Fetch metadata for any new token addresses via `T` (ERC-20 symbol / decimals over RPC).
5. Insert `BlockChanges` into `ReorgBuffer`.
6. When `ReorgBuffer` has `>= commit_batch_size` blocks before `finalized_block_height`, drain them
   and schedule a DB write (see Persistence).
7. Aggregate all tx-level deltas → `BlockAggregatedChanges`; compute TVL.
8. Broadcast `Arc<BlockAggregatedChanges>` to subscribers.

### Partial-block path

Some chains (e.g. Base) emit multiple partial messages per block. While
`partial_block_index.is_some()`, each message is merged into `PartialBlockBuffer` (a single
`Option<BlockChanges>`). An aggregated message is broadcast immediately for WebSocket consumers,
but the block is **not** inserted into `ReorgBuffer` or written to DB until the full-block signal
arrives (clearing the buffer).

### DCI (Dynamic Contract Indexer) — optional

`ExtractorExtension::process_block_update()` is called on the accumulated `BlockChanges` before
aggregation. The DCI uses entry-point tracing results (`trace_results`) to extract additional
contract state and injects it back into `BlockChanges`. Two implementations exist:
`DynamicContractIndexer` (`dci.rs` — generic EVM tracing) and `HooksDCI` (`hooks/hook_dci.rs` —
UniswapV4-style hooks with permission detection and protocol-specific metadata via `integrations/`).
When no DCI is configured the call is a no-op.

### Revert handling

On `BlockUndoSignal(target_hash, target_number)` from Substreams:

1. `ReorgBuffer::purge_to(target_hash, target_number)` removes invalidated blocks. A hash
   match purges strictly after the target; when the hash is absent, a buffered target height
   purges from that height inclusive (stale copy). A hash miss is fatal when the
   target is below the buffer, at the buffer's oldest block (no predecessor left to
   anchor the revert), or above the buffer without a pending partial at exactly that height
   (the flashblocks case — the only legitimate target-ahead shape). Nonfatal hash-miss
   fallbacks log a warning and increment `extractor_revert_hash_miss`.
2. Pending partials are dropped only when above the target height; partials at the target
   height are the still-valid prefix of the last valid block and are kept.
3. Previous attribute values are restored from the buffer, then the DB. The buffer keeps
   drained blocks in a committing section until `CachedGateway` reports their write
   flushed, so lookups cover every block whose write has not landed and a DB miss proves
   that no prior state exists — the revert never waits on the commit task. Attributes
   first created inside the reverted range revert as deletions when they survive the
   range, and revert to nothing otherwise. A delta that holds an attribute as both
   created and deleted is malformed module output, so it goes through the lookup like a
   pre-existing attribute. Attributes with no prior value anywhere revert as deletions,
   emit one summary warning, and increment `extractor_revert_attr_miss` per attribute; its
   `component_state_found` label says whether the DB returned state rows for the
   component. The extractor registers both label sets at zero at startup so the first
   miss is visible to `increase()`. Any hit means an upstream module emitted an Update
   or Deletion for an attribute that never had a Creation.
4. If nothing was invalidated, only the cursor advances — no message is emitted. Otherwise
   a `BlockAggregatedChanges` with `revert = true` is broadcast.
5. **No DB rollback is needed** — only finalized blocks ever reach the DB, so the persisted
   state is always on the canonical chain.

`PendingDeltasBuffer` (RPC side) mirrors this with its own `ReorgBuffer`, using the strict
hash-only `purge` on the block named by the broadcast revert message.

## Persistence

`CachedGateway` enqueues `WriteOp` messages; `DBCacheWriteExecutor` flushes them when the next
block batch arrives. Writes follow a fixed FK-safe order (block → tx → contracts → tokens →
components → state → entry points → cursor). Every mutable row is versioned with `valid_from` /
`valid_to` — historical rows are never mutated (see `tycho-storage/CLAUDE.md`).

**Trigger:** `ReorgBuffer::drain_blocks_until(finalized_height)` — blocks are only committed once
they are provably behind the finality horizon.

Drained blocks stay in the buffer's committing section (shared with the commit task via
`Arc`) until `CachedGateway::flushed_block_height` passes them, so revert lookups can
still see them while their write is in flight.

## Why extractor messages must be broadcast to the RPC service

HTTP snapshot endpoints must reflect the latest state, including blocks not yet committed to DB.
Every `BlockAggregatedChanges` message is sent to `PendingDeltasBuffer` (in addition to WebSocket
clients). When an RPC query arrives, the handler fetches the DB snapshot then applies in-memory
pending deltas on top, giving a consistent view up to the chain tip. Without this feed the RPC
would lag by however many blocks remain in `ReorgBuffer` awaiting finalization.

`db_committed_block_height` on each message tells `PendingDeltasBuffer` when a block has been
written; it auto-drains those blocks so memory usage stays bounded.

## Client Sync

Changes to RPC endpoints in `services/rpc.rs` require updates to both `tycho-client/` (Rust) and
`tycho-client-py/` (Python). See `.claude/knowledge/python.md` for the Python sync checklist.
