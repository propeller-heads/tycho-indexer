            Review this PR. Be concise and actionable.

            Rules:
            - Do NOT post a PR-level summary comment or long-form feedback on the PR. The main comment should only briefly summarize the severity of the issues found.
            - Only add inline comments on lines that need a concrete fix or real concern. No praise, no "strengths", no recap of what the PR does.
            - Each inline comment: keep each comment short - state the issue and the suggested change. No long explanations unless necessary.
            - Check existing PR comments (gh pr view) and do not repeat or rephrase existing feedback/comments. Add comments in response to replies to previous comments if more context is needed.
            - If you find nothing substantive to fix, leave a very short comment noting that.
            - Ignore style/nits unless they cause real bugs, maintainability problems or impact readability.

            Focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Security implications
            - Performance considerations
