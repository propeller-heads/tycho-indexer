# Transparency

### Tycho is free and open source

Tycho is, and always will be, free software, open source, and MIT licensed.

**Free hosted indexer**: Today, we host a free indexer for each chain, and we aim to maintain this indefinitely. If this ever changes, you will know at least 3 months ahead of time and have enough time to host your own indexer.

### Indexer Redundancy

We are working with independent third parties to host additional indexers, both free and paid – to add redundancy to our indexer.

### Tycho's Financial Model

Tycho finances development and maintenance through:

* **Grants:** Tycho receives grants from chains, DEXs, and others that benefit from the flow that Tycho brings.
* **Tools built on Tycho**: Useful tooling built on Tycho with a fee model (Coming soon).&#x20;
